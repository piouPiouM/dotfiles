# Global rules

## Code structure and style

- **ALWAYS** generate code in **English**.
- Write clean, maintainable code following standard conventions.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting.
- Break complex operations into smaller, focused functions.
- Keep functions and methods concise and single-purpose.
- Use functional over procedural programming.

## Documentation and comments

- Document assumptions with `# ASSUMPTION: [description]`.
- Mark incomplete work with `# TODO: [description]`.
- Flag uncertainties with `# QUESTION: [description]`.
- Add clarifying comments for complex logic.
- Avoid redundant or obvious comments.
- Use clear, grammatically correct language in comments.

## Error handling

- Implement appropriate error checking.
- Handle edge cases gracefully.
- Use descriptive error messages.
- Consider failure scenarios in your implementations.

## Code quality

- Prioritize readability over cleverness.
- Avoid deep nesting of conditionals.
- Keep logic paths clear and easy to follow.
- Remove unused code or imports.
- Follow the **Single Responsability Principle** when appropriate.
- Follow **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles when appropriate.
- Follow **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles when appropriate.

## Communication with Developer

- If you lack necessary context, state your assumptions clearly.
- When making significant design decisions, explain your reasoning.
- If you notice potential issues with the requested changes, raise them.
- Ask for clarification when instructions are ambiguous.

## Performance and security

- Write efficient code where possible.
- Consider time and space complexity for data structures and algorithms.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
- Implement basic input validation where appropriate.

## Code generation guidelines

- Generate complete, functional code unless explicitly asked for partial implementation.
- Include clear parameter and return type definitions where applicable.
- Add error handling for obvious edge cases.
- Structure code to be easily testable.
- Follow modular design principles.

## Refactoring Guidelines

- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it.
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible.
- Document significant structural changes.
- Keep changes focused and purposeful.

## Best Practices

- Keep code modular and maintainable.
- Implement proper encapsulation.
- Follow language-specific conventions.
- Consider code reusability.
