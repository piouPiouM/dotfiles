Manage backup, restore, and installation of my environments [since 2011](https://github.com/piouPiouM/dotfiles/commit/ec918b4). Based on the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to maintain symlinks to my home directory. Mainly to reduce the mess in my `$HOME` üç∫

## Contents

As Front-end developer, I am using CLI in my day-to-day workflow. The tools I use most frequently have their configuration versioned in this repository:

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as terminal emulator.
- Zsh as main shell with [zim](https://zimfw.sh/) to manage shell plugins and [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as main editor and visual editor.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) as command-line fuzzy finder üå∏
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) as search and replace tool.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) as fast and user-friendly alternative to find.
- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) as git Terminal UI (_TUI_).

### Linux

I using Fedora with Wayland, switch between GNOME Desktop Environment and Sway compositor.

- DNF and Flatpak as packages manager.

### macOS

I also use macOS in my daily life.

- Homebrew as packages manager.

## Installation

> **Warning**  
> This repository covers my personal needs. I do not recommend that you run the setup or installation tasks without reviewing the code and understanding its impact. Use at your own risk!

You can start by cloning the repository.

```sh
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/piouPiouM/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
```

> **Note**
> I use `~/.dotfiles` as the destination directory because an alias allows me to directly edit the folder from any location: [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/piouPiouM/dotfiles/blob/ddc85554b0d2e5c9e6a386800612130c2d246e4d/zsh/.config/zsh/plugins/aliases/init.zsh#L16).
### Installation √† la carte

The best option for controlling your environment: install only what you need. However, 3 tasks will be required to ensure that the other automated tasks run smoothly:

```sh
$ make install-dirs install-stow install-links
```

Now you can browse the available tasks using the `make help` command. 
### Fresh operating system installation?

These instructions are for setting up new macOS or Fedora operating system.

```sh
$ make setup
```

> **Warning**  
> It's a WIP target knowing that I'm adding cross-platform support and that I don't reinstall my OS every day üòÇ

### Install without alter the system?

```sh
$ make install
```

## Local override

I use my dotfiles for personal and professional purposes, on distinct devices. Some information such as my git email address or business scripts, are stored specifically on each machine. To help me, some non-versioned configuration files can be loaded:

- Shell environment: `~/.local/share/zsh/exports.zsh`.
- Git: `~/.local/share/git/config` (copy [local-config.sample](https://github.com/piouPiouM/dotfiles/blob/ddc85554b0d2e5c9e6a386800612130c2d246e4d/git/.local/share/git/local-config.sample)).

| App             | Config file                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Zsh environment | `~/.local/share/zsh/exports.zsh`                           |
| Git             | `~/.local/share/git/config` (see [local-config.sample][1]) |

## Automated tasks

I heavily use [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to automatize my maintenance tasks.  
_Why Make?_ Because it's commonly shipped with \*nix OS. I can directly launch the setup process without installing anything else.

> **Note**  
> The accessible targets are dynamically created to be conform with the current OS.  See [include/make/](./include/make/) directory.

### Backup settings

```sh
$ make backup
```

Saves manually changed or added items in the [`setup`](./setup/) directory:

| What?               | Linux | Fedora | macOS |
| ------------------- |:-----:|:------:|:-----:|
| DNF & Corp Repo     |       |   ‚úÖ   |       |
| Flatpak apps        |  ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |       |
| GNOME extensions    |  ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |       |
| GNOME settings      |  ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |       |
| Homebrew packages   |       |        |  ‚úÖ   |
| NPM global packages |  ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |  ‚úÖ   |

### Neovim

My Neovim configuration is the one that evolves most frequently. The plugins I use are no exception, as the Neovim ecosystem is so rich and constantly evolving.  I use [many plugins](https://github.com/piouPiouM/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/.config/nvim/lua/ppm/plugin/init.lua)  like:

- [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for manage my plugins
- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)  as langage parser
- [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) as LSP configuration helper
- [lspsaga.nvim](https://github.com/nvimdev/lspsaga.nvim) for improve Neovim LSP experience
- [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) as powerful fuzzy finder üå∏
- [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) as completion engine
- [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) for customize the status bar, tabs and winbar
- [leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim) as motion helper ü¶ò
- [gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) to integrate Git into Neovim

```sh
$ make setup-neovim
```

The task will install Neovim Nightly (which follows the HEAD of the git master branch) with the needed dependencies and providers. 
### Fonts

```sh
$ make install-fonts
```

Launch installation of used font-faces, mainly:

- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) as monospace font.
- [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) for Obsidian.
- [Nerds Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to enhance my TUI.

> **Note**  
> Symbols of Nerd Fonts are installed by the [`install-fonts-nerd-symbols-only`](https://github.com/piouPiouM/dotfiles/blob/ddc85554b0d2e5c9e6a386800612130c2d246e4d/include/make/target-fonts.mk#L43-L54) target, which also updates the list of symbols in [Kitty's configuration](./kitty/.config/kitty/nerd-fonts.conf) in order to always be up to date ü™Ñ

### Themes

After years of using the [Iceberg](https://cocopon.github.io/iceberg.vim/) theme for Vim and Neovim, I've decided to opt for these 3 themes, which also offer satisfactory light variations: [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/), [Ros√© Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) and [NightFox](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim).

```sh
$ make install-themes
```

Where available, themes for these tools are also downloaded:

| App          | Catppuccin | Ros√© Pine | NightFox |
| ------------ |:----------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| bat          |     ‚úÖ     |    ‚úÖ     |          |
| btop         |     ‚úÖ     |           |          |
| fzf          |     ‚úÖ     |    ‚úÖ     |          |
| kitty        |     ‚úÖ     |    ‚úÖ     |    ‚úÖ    |
| lazygit      |     ‚úÖ     |           |          |
| neovim       |     ‚úÖ     |    ‚úÖ     |    ‚úÖ    |
| rofi (linux) |     ‚úÖ     |    ‚úÖ     |          |

Each theme can be individually installed or updated with the tasks `theme-catppuccin`, `theme-rose-pine` or `theme-nightfox`.

Each tool requires its own method for using a theme. This is automated with the `colorscheme dark|light|soft-dark|soft-light` shell command. The preference is saved in the `~/.theme` file ([home/dot-theme](./home/dot-theme)).

```sh
$  colorscheme light
‚çª Theme applied for Kitty
‚çª Theme applied for Bat
‚çª Theme applied for btop
‚çª Theme applied for fzf
‚çª Theme applied for Lazygit
```

> **Note**  
> Neovim does not yet benefit from this automation.

## FAQ
### How do I force a task to run?

The way Make works means that some tasks will have no effect because the files downloaded or created already exist on disk. Use the `-B` flag to force execution of the task:

```sh
$ make theme-rose-pine # Do nothing

$ make -B theme-rose-pine # Force
‚Ä¢ Download rose-pine.sh for fzf
‚Ä¢ Download rose-pine-dawn.sh for fzf
‚Ä¢ Download rose-pine-moon.sh for fzf
‚Ä¢ Download rose-pine.rasi theme for Rofi
‚Ä¢ Download rose-pine-dawn.rasi theme for Rofi
‚Ä¢ Download rose-pine-moon.rasi theme for Rofi
```
### Error `zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list`

This error may occur when opening a new shell. The following command will certainly solve the problem:

```sh
$ compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
```

### Error `trash: error -1701`

If you get this error when using Kitty, you need to reset the Finder access permissions using the following command. A
confirmation prompt will be displayed the next time you run the `trash` command.

```sh
$ tccutil reset AppleEvents net.kovidgoyal.kitty
```
