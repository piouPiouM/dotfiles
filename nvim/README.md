# Neovim

I've been using Vim and Neovim for nearly 15 years. Its configuration is constantly evolving according to my needs, my curiosity and the new features offered by the community.

My **leader key** is the `Space` and my *local leader key* is `Ã¹` because these keys are easily accessible from an AZERTY keyboard.

## Plugins

I use [many plugins](https://github.com/piouPiouM/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/), the main ones being :

- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for manage my plugins
- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)  as langage parser
- [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) as LSP configuration helper
- [lspsaga.nvim](https://github.com/nvimdev/lspsaga.nvim) for improve Neovim LSP experience
- [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) as powerful fuzzy finder ðŸŒ¸
- [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) as completion engine
- [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) for customize the status bar, tabs and winbar
- [leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim) as motion helper ðŸ¦˜
- [gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) to integrate Git into Neovim

## Pickers

Like everyone else, I use a set of pickers to navigate efficiently through my code bases. These pickers are powered by [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua), which offers great responsiveness. Accustomed to the layouts of the Telescope plugin, I have created [4 new themes](./.config/nvim/lua/ppm/plugin/fzf-lua/themes.lua) for fzf-lua:
